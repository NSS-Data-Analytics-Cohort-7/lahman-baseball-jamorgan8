/*4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.*/

SELECT
    CASE WHEN pos = 'SS' OR pos = '1B' OR pos = '2B' OR pos = '3B' THEN 'Infield'
         WHEN pos = 'P' OR pos = 'C' THEN 'Battery'

--trends?

SELECT
    CASE WHEN sq.decade = 2010 THEN CONCAT(sq.decade, '-', sq.decade+6)
        ELSE CONCAT(sq.decade, '-', sq.decade+9) END AS decade,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_strikeouts), 2) AS avg_strikeouts

        SELECT
            CAST(SUM(so) AS DECIMAL)/CAST(SUM(g) AS DECIMAL) AS avg_strikeouts,
            (yearid/10)*10 AS decade,
            g/2 AS num_games,
            COUNT(teamid) AS team

        WHERE ((yearid/10)*10) >= 1920
        GROUP BY decade, num_games
    ) AS sq
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY decade;

/*to find avg strikeouts I divided sum of strikeouts by sum of games. In teams table, strikeouts and games are represented per team. I totaled ALL strikeouts and divided by ALL games to get the average per decade*/
